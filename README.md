<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of TreeFire is to provide accessible, open source tools to
explore and retrieve data on the International Multiproxy Paleofire
Database (IMPD). The IMPD is a service of the World Data System
(WDS-Paleo) and is hosted by the NOAA National Center for Environmental
Information. Learn more from
<https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/paleoclimatology/fire-history>.

The TreeFire app is based on a R package, `rIMPD`, that can found at
<https://github.com/chguiterman/rIMPD>

These tools are under active development. **Please explore at your own
risk.**
